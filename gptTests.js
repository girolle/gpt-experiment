Use "List of correctly completed items" section for exact items from checklist which you consider as correctly completed. Never explain or comment anything in this section.
Use "List of possible improvements" section for exact items from checklist which you don't consider as mistakes, but it's better to improve them.

#### List of items that could not be checked: (e.g \`‚ùî The index.html file\n\n\`)
#### Conclusion: (briefly describe the result of the check)
