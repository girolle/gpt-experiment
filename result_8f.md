 - normalize.css should be imported before other CSS files in index.css.

#### List of correctly completed items:
‚úÖ The layout doesn't break between breakpoints

‚úÖ The cumulative value of the width, padding, and margin properties for each element is specified to within 30px of the design requirements at the 1280px breakpoint. It should also be within 10px of the design requirements at the following breakpoints: 768px, 320px

‚úÖ Stylesheets do not use tag selectors to set CSS rules.

‚úÖ No more than two selectors are nested in any CSS rule.

‚úÖ Stylesheets and images are located in separate folders and organized into blocks. Files are all organized within a Flat BEM file structure.

‚úÖ Blocks are imported into the corresponding page file. CSS rules for elements and modifiers are declared in the corresponding CSS block file.

‚úÖ Modifiers do not contain duplicate styles of the element or block being modified. They contain only the changing properties.

‚úÖ There are no class attributes with a BEM modifier as their only value.

‚úÖ Components that share similar styles or functions constitute a single BEM entity, i.e., a block or an element.

‚úÖ An active popup box is created using a BEM modifier with the necessary CSS properties.

#### List of possible improvements:
None

#### List of items that could not be checked:
None

#### Conclusion:

#### List of items that could not be checked:

‚ùî The popup must be opened once the modal_opened is added manually in the HTML

‚ùî The popup must be closed when the modal_opened is removed from HTML

‚ùî The popups are created with HTML and CSS. They shouldn't be created dynamically with JS

#### Conclusion:
The provided JavaScript code contains an initial cards array with incorrect usage of the URL function. The rest of the checklist items could not be checked due to the absence of the related code.

## Final Conclusion:

Overall, the project is well-structured and follows the guidelines provided. The HTML and CSS code is mostly correct, with only a few minor issues that need to be addressed, such as the import order of normalize.css in index.css and the missing .prettierignore file. The Readme file is informative and could benefit from the addition of more visual content. The JavaScript code provided has an issue with the URL function usage, and the rest of the checklist items could not be checked due to the absence of the related code. Once these issues are resolved, the project will be in excellent shape. Keep up the good work!
