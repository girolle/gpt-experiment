**Intro**
  
This project was designed to better practice the grid system while further understanding advanced HTML and CSS concepts such as media queries that alter the project's size based on different screen sizes.


**Figma**

For Around The U.S., I sourced all images and vector designs from the Figma page, which included image sizing, fonts, margin widths, and detailed how the finished project should look.
