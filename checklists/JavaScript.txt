**All of the features listed in the brief have been implemented and are functioning properly:**
6 cards have been created and rendered via JavaScript.
The modal for editing the profile has been correctly coded in HTML and CSS. This includes making sure that the following features are implemented:
It has a form with two fields titled "Name" and "About me", a "Save" and “Close” buttons.
The popup box has the properties that are defined in the project description.
The popup must be opened once the modal\_opened is added manually in the HTML. By default, the user shouldn't see the modal box.
The popup must be closed when the modal\_opened is removed from HTML.
The popups are created with HTML and CSS. They shouldn't be created dynamically with JS.
